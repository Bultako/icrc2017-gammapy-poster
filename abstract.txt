Gammapy is a Python package for high-level gamma-ray data analysis, written in Python and built on Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. Starting with event lists and instrument response information, it is possible to analyse gamma-ray data and to create for example sky images, spectra and lightcurves, and to determine the position, morphology and spectra of gamma-ray sources.

So far Gammapy has mostly been used to analyse data from H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT, and now it is being used for the simulation and analysis of observations from the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We have proposed Gammapy as a prototype for the CTA science tools. This contribution will give an overview of the Gammapy package and show analysis application examples with simulated CTA data.
